            <p>Josh Davila is an artist and researcher working at the intersection of <strong>AI, digital art, and philosophy</strong>. His practice is deeply influenced by <strong>Experimental Surrealism</strong>, a <strong>self-coined movement</strong> that integrates AI and emerging technologies into contemporary surrealist exploration. Through his work, he examines how machines reconstruct meaning, distort human perception, and serve as tools for processing trauma and fragmented identity.</p>

            <p>A <strong>self-taught digital artist</strong>, Davila first turned to AI-generated art as a means of <strong>navigating personal trauma, homelessness, and mental health struggles</strong>. What began as an experiment in human-machine collaboration quickly evolved into a broader artistic exploration, blending <strong>machine intelligence, abstraction, and the unconscious</strong> to uncover new visual languages. His work is informed by a deep-rooted passion for <strong>philosophy, linguistics, and art history</strong>, disciplines that continue to shape his approach to AI-driven art.</p>

            <p>He has exhibited with institutions such as the <strong>San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture, Non-Fungible Conference Lisbon, and NFT Los Angeles</strong>, as well as many individual and group features. His early artworks have been minted as NFTs on various marketplaces, including <strong>Objkt, Foundation, KnownOrigin, and Zero One</strong>.</p>

            <p>His major projects include <strong>Augmented Nature</strong>, a digital series that reframes AI as an extension of the natural world; <strong>Synonyms & Antonyms</strong>, an ongoing project exploring language through AI’s interpretation of words; and <strong>Solitude</strong>, a personal reflection on trauma and abuse.</p>

            <p>Davila’s early works were minted under the alias <strong>N1FTEY</strong>, a <strong>Web3-native identity</strong> he originally used to explore blockchain art while maintaining anonymity. He continues to manage these smart contracts, preserving his earliest AI art on platforms like Objkt, Foundation, KnownOrigin, and Zero One.
